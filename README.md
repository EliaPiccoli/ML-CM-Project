# ML-CM-Project

Project for the Machine Learning &amp; Computational Mathematics for Learning and Data Analysis 2020/2021 @ University of Pisa

# Machine Learning
### Project A+CM
Implementation of various models for *classification* task on:
- [Monk](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK%27s+Problems) 
- ML CUP

The models that implemented are the following:
 - SVM/SVR with different kernels
 - Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)

# Computational Mathematics for Learning and Data Analysis

### Project 14
*(Model)* is a SVR-type approach of your choice (in particular, with one or more kernels of your choice).

*(Algorithm)* is a dual approach with appropriate choices of the constraints to be dualized, where the Lagrangian Dual is solved by an algorithm of the class of deflected subgradient methods.

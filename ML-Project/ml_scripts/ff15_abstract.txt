We propose as final model a combination of an ensemble of 5 Neural Network and a Multi-Output Regressor SVR.
All constituent components are selected through a coarse to fine grid search using Hold Out validation.
The entire data set is split as follows: 80/20% development and internal test sets, furthermore development set
is once again split in 80/20% training and validation sets.
